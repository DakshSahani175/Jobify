# Jobify
This is MERN based website where you can check all available jobs, create jobs etc. This is my very first MERN project. I build this under the step by step guidance through a Udemy course - "MERN Stack Course 2023 - MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS".
The link of the web-app is [https://jobify-0fwn.onrender.com/]
